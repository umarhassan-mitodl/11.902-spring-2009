11.902 is an advanced reading class. The course assignments were mainly weekly reflections of the assigned readings.

Assignments also consisted of a leading class discussion and a final paper.

Leading Class Discussion
------------------------

Each student will be responsible for leading at least two class discussions. Discussion sessions will be scheduled in the second week of the class.

A Final Paper (if taking the seminar for 9 credit units)
--------------------------------------------------------

Students will write a final paper for the class if they decide to take the course for more than 6 credit units. It could either be a research paper or proposal. The project will be divided into two parts:

*   A class presentation of the project at the end of the semester
*   A final paper (or research proposal) that is due 10 days after Ses #12
